I am now an applied researcher at eBay inc., working on developing and deploying scalable and extensible recommendation algorithms. 
Previously, I worked as a senior algorithm engineer in the search and recommendation team at Alibaba inc., where  
I developed web-scale search & recommendation algorithms and published several papers in top-tier conferences. 
In 2019, I obtained my PH.D. in computer Science at Zhejiang University.
I am also very fortunate to work with [Kun Zhang](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/ "kun zhang") (CMU), 
who is knowledgeable, visionary, and inspiring. He helps to shape my thinking toward connections between causality and machine learning.
 
I have a broad interest in machine learning and its efficient practice in reality. 
Especially, I am passionate about information retrieval on Internet (e.g., Search, Recommendation, and Ads) 
since it has a comprehensive and profound influence on everyone's life.
I have hands-on experiences both in industry and academia, which brings me 
a better understanding of their knowing-doing gap, tradeoffs between system and algorithm, and shifting of data distribution.
Current the paradigm of information retrieval (e.g., training, metrics, feedback circle, etc.) are far from perfection, and I am working
with passion for better solutions (more unbiased, efficient and social good).
 Drop me an email if you wanna get in touch for discussion or any kind of cooperation.
